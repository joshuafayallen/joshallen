        "I suppose at some point it is good to become more well versed in lots of tools. I have been python curious for about a year or so and I think it is important to use the tool best suited for the task. Also sometimes it is important to get out of your comfort zone. I am definitely somebody who is very comfortable in R and the `tidyverse` and use it for a lot of stuff. I have heard lots of ravings about polars specifically about its speed and similarities in intuition with the tidyverse. So I thought I would have a collection of code for myself and the people of the internet to reference. \n",

This is really just me working through the similarities and is going to be based on the [tidyintelligence's blog post](https://blog.tidy-intelligence.com/posts/dplyr-vs-polars/), [Robert Mitchell's blog post](https://robertmitchellv.com/blog/2022-07-r-python-side-by-side/r-python-side-by-side.html), and [Emily Rieder's blog post](https://www.emilyriederer.com/post/py-rgo-polars/). In all honesty this is just for me to smash them together to have a one stop shop for myself. If you found this post over these resources I highly recommend you checking out these resources. \n",
