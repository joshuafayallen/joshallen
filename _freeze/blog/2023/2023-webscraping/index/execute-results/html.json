I was also hired on to an NSF grant to do some data collection. Based on the data I needed for my dissertation and the data collection for the grant all this entailed a ton of web scraping. Which I had largely avoided before this and felt like out of my skill set. After like six months of having to do this more or less every week I decided to write this post to demystify the process a bit and for me to refer back to from time to time.\n\n## My Approach To Webscraping \n\n\n For the most part webscraping is more like a solving a mystery rather than building a skyscrapper. What I mean is that rather than building a large infrastructure like an R package or an app you are really just figuring out what other people did. I assure you if you stumbled upon this humble blog you have had to do this before! This is no different just either way more fun or way more frustrating(often it is both).\n\n\n# What we will cover\n\nIn this post we will go over the basics of webscraping. What does that mean?\n\n\n- What to look for\n\n- How to scrape it\n\n- Dealing strings.\n\n\n\n# What will you need \n\n\nIn this post I will use these packages:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(rvest, polite,tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThese are really the bread and butter of webscraping in R and for the most part the fundamentals of what to look for should translate over to other webscraping tools like `beautifulsoup`. \n\n\n\n# What will we be scraping?\n\n\nThe website we will be scraping today is: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_url(\"https://variety.com/2023/music/news/taylor-swift-eras-tour-surprise-songs-list-1235578714/\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nEllise Shafer maintains a complete list of every surprise song that has been played on Taylor Swift's Eras tour. Practically it has some interesting information as well as some challenges you may or may not run into when webscrapping. Our goal is to get a datset that looks like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(DT)\n\nts = read_csv(\"data/surprise_songs_by_night.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 60 Columns: 17\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (14): value, city, state, surprise_songs, location, fix_state, fix_city...\ndbl   (2): lat, long\ndate  (1): date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndatatable(ts)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\"
