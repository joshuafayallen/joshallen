<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Since may I have had to start collecting data for my dissertation which is exciting and a little scary. I was also hired on to an NSF grant to do some data collection. Based on the data I needed for my dissertation and the data collection for the grant all this entailed a ton of web scraping. Which I had largely avoided before this and felt like out of my skill set. After like six months of having to do this more or less every week I decided to write this post to demystify the process a bit and for me to refer back to from time to time.</p>
<section id="my-approach-to-webscraping" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-approach-to-webscraping">My Approach To Webscraping</h2>
<p>For the most part webscraping is more like a solving a mystery rather than building a skyscrapper. What I mean is that rather than building a large infrastructure like an R package or an app you are really just figuring out what other people did. I assure you if you stumbled upon this humble blog you have had to do this before! This is no different just either way more fun or way more frustrating(often it is both).</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="what-we-will-cover" class="level1">
<h1>What we will cover</h1>
<p>In this post we will go over the basics of webscraping. What does that mean?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What to look for</p></li>
<li><p>How to scrape it</p></li>
<li><p>Dealing strings.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="what-will-you-need" class="level1">
<h1>What will you need</h1>
<p>In this post I will use these packages:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>pacman<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">p_load</span>(rvest, polite,tidyverse)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>These are really the bread and butter of webscraping in R and for the most part the fundamentals of what to look for should translate over to other webscraping tools like <code>beautifulsoup</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-will-we-be-scraping" class="level1">
<h1>What will we be scraping?</h1>
<p>The website we will be scraping today is:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>knitr<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">include_url</span>(<span class="st">"https://variety.com/2023/music/news/taylor-swift-eras-tour-surprise-songs-list-1235578714/"</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Ellise Shafer maintains a complete list of every surprise song that has been played on Taylor Swift’s Eras tour. Practically it has some interesting information as well as some challenges you may or may not run into when webscrapping. Our goal is to get a datset that looks like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(DT)</span>
